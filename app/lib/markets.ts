/* Related-market linking, shared by all six discipline hubs.
 *
 * The problem this solves, measured rather than assumed:
 *
 * Every city page used to end with a link to all 49 sibling cities in its
 * own hub. Comparing /mep-engineering-recruiter/boston-ma against
 * /mep-engineering-recruiter/buffalo-ny with a 6-word shingle test, 800 of
 * 1,087 words were identical, and that link list was one of the largest
 * single blocks in it — 84 words, character for character the same on all
 * fifty pages. Same-hub/different-city overlap sat at 71-74%, while
 * same-city/different-hub sat at 32-37%, barely above the ~30% floor that
 * the shared header and footer alone produce. So the duplication ran
 * entirely along the city axis, and this block was a measurable part of it.
 *
 * It was also poor linking on its own terms. Forty-nine links pointing
 * everywhere spread the page's internal signal evenly and say nothing about
 * which page matters; and there was no link at all from Boston MEP to Boston
 * Civil, even though those are the same market and the same buyer.
 *
 * So: a regional slice of the same discipline, plus the same city in the
 * other disciplines. Both vary per page, which is the point — a block that
 * differs city to city stops being boilerplate.
 *
 * Every hub carries an identical slug list (verified: the fifty slugs hash
 * the same across all five data files), so a cross-hub link is always valid.
