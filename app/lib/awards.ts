/* The award programs our clients' projects compete in.
 *
 * Metro does not enter these — a recruiting firm can't win an engineering
 * award. What this list is for: the firms we staff do enter them, and the
 * language of the industry ("ACEC Engineering Excellence", "ASHRAE
 * Technology Award", "ENR Best Projects") is how hiring managers and
 * candidates describe the work they want to be part of. Naming the programs
 * on the discipline hubs puts that vocabulary on the page, in context,
 * pointed at the official source.
 *
 * Rules this file follows, and should keep following:
 *   1. No claim that Metro or any named client won anything. If the client
 *      gives us verified wins, those belong here as facts with a year — a
 *      real win beats a list of programs every time.
 *   2. `logo` holds the ORGANIZATION's own mark, taken from that
 *      organization's own site, shown beside a link to the program it runs
 *      and under a notice naming the owner and disclaiming affiliation —
 *      nominative use, which is what keeps it defensible. A WINNER badge is
 *      a different thing entirely and must never appear here: ENR and ACEC
 *      license those to actual winners, and Metro cannot win an engineering
 *      award. Programs with no file fall back to a typographic tile built
 *      from `abbr`, which is our own artwork and carries no license at all.
 *   3. Every URL is the organization's own award page, checked before it
 *      was added. Several of these hosts return 403 to scripted requests
 *      (Cloudflare) — that is bot filtering, not a dead link.
 *   4. `categories` is ILLUSTRATIVE, never exhaustive. These programs
 *      restructure their category lists between years, and a stale list
 *      presented as complete is worse than a short one presented as a
 *      sample — so the detail page renders it under "Categories include"
 *      and sends the reader to the organization for the current rules.
 *   5. `hiringSignal` is Metro's own opinion, not the organization's, and
 *      the page labels it as ours. Everything else on this page is either
 *      a fact about the program or a link to the body that runs it.
