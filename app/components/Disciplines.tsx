/**
 * The six discipline hubs, on the homepage.
 *
 * Why this exists: the homepage carried seventeen internal links and not one
 * of them went to a discipline. The footer's "Services" column printed six
 * service names all pointing at "/#services". So the six hubs and the 250
 * city pages beneath them had no internal link path from anywhere on the
 * site — they existed only in sitemap.xml.
 *
 * Search Console showed the result precisely: 163 URLs in "Discovered -
 * currently not indexed", every one with Last crawled "N/A", the
 * /mep-engineering-recruiter, /cei-inspection-recruiter,
 * /water-wastewater-recruiter and /bridge-structural-recruiter hubs among
 * them. Google had the URLs and had never fetched a single one. A sitemap
 * says a URL exists; internal links say it matters, and nothing said it.
 *
 * The metro links are deliberate too, not decoration: they put the largest
 * markets one click from the homepage instead of three, which is the
 * difference between a page a crawler reaches early and one it never
 * budgets for.
